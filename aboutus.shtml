			<h2>History</h2></div>
		<p class="txtP">
			Charlie &amp; Heath have been servicing computers for over a decade. 
			Lifelong friends, they harnessed the power of their 1.75 college degrees and started a daring and provocative blimp construction venture. 
			Encircled by their encroaching creditors, they caught a lucky gust of wind to the Pacific Northwest and established Geek Serv in 2007. <br><br>
			Today they are happy to help the Greater Seattle community with only the finest quality on-site computer service and support.</p></div>

			<h2>Meet the Owners, Charlie &amp; Heath</h2></div>
		<p  class="txtP">
			Born in the year of the dragon, fed only cornstarch and maple syrup, and exposed to one hour of sunlight per day, they have grown into strong and noble creatures.<br><br>
			Years of radioactive exposure have imbued them with the uncanny ability to rearrange computer electrons at will. 
			Known as "the box whisperers" amongst industry peers, they travel to strange new places and build order amidst the technological chaos.<br><br>
			Their interests include Tai Chi, the music of the mariachi and the cultured and ancient city of Karachi.</p></div></div>
