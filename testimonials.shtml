			<tr><td colspan ="2">Whenever I have a problem all I have to do is call Geek Serv and they look at my laptop. If there is anything wrong with it they tell me what is wrong and how much it would cost. Not even A-1 Best Computer does that, they charge an arm to get food in your computer, to install a faulty virus protection, and to take important files off your computer to "make room for the other programs". Whose computer do they think it is? Also, they jack their prices up. Geek Serv has the most reasonable prices for a student out there. They even have a virus protection program that works, for free!</td></tr>

Not so with Geek Serv! Charlie and Heath are as honest as they are honorable; completely upfront about estimated time and expense for repair or replacement; and thorough and articulate in their diagnoses, prognoses, and guidance. Prompt and patient, their location makes it possible for them to serve a population that otherwise would have to go a great distance and pay a great price. Thank you, thank you. </td></tr>

The best thing about it is that I now have a fast connection versus the very slow one I had with my old computer.

I was just about to toss my computer but decided to give it one last chance. I Googled "mobile computer repair" and found Geek Serv. Heath answered the phone and right away told me there was a good chance my computer was worth fixing. He was at my home within a few hours and saved my PC and my sanity for a fraction of the cost of a new one. I am a happy camper and am recommending Geek Serv to all of my friends, who, like me, have NO idea why their computers are acting up. Thanks, Geek Serv! </td></tr>

He recommended a new refurbished computer replacement because the time and cost to fix the problem was close to the cost of the new computer. I am very happy with my new computer because it is much better than the old one. I highly recommended them to anyone.</td></tr>
